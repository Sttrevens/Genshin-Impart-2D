*** This Assets Required ShaderGraph to work.
That mean you need to download pakage Lightweight RP , Shader Graph in Window > Pakage Manager
and then set the Pipeline to Lightweight RP in Edit > Project Settings > Graphics > insert Lightweight RP that you have downloaded in the Pipeline settings tab

The Particle Effects Divided in to 2 type

1. use material from Shader Graph (you can edit the colors and some setting in material in the folder ShaderGraph > material)
   *the list of Effects name that use Shader Graph
	Flame01
	Flame02
	IceCrack(Child in freeze01)
	Darkness

2. use material frome default particles shader (you can edit directly in the Particles setting itself)

Tips
-Freeze02 If you want to get rid of the blurly thing just uncheck the size over lifetime.
-Aura If you want it to be brighter go set the alpha of the color, emission rate and size help too or just edit directly in the texture.
-Darkness Start Size is the canvas of effect.

Most of the texture , sprites have alpha channel or transparency So you can use it overlay.
All the Particles Mean to use at the Edge of the screen but it can develop in to the other effects as well.

I hope you can make good use of this assets and wish for your best, If you have any question feel free to ask me at twitter.
